Write README file in Git for the following project

You have recently been hired by a bookstore chain, Captain Book. After opening quite a few brick-and-mortar stores on the West Coast, they finally made the decision to go online. So far, it has proved to be a great success! 
You have been at the company for about a week, and your manager just announced your first project: to analyze the sales of the company in order to target new areas of growth. Your manager also sees this project as a means to test your skills.
The IT department has given you access to the sales database. It's up to you to familiarize yourself with the data and analyze it.
Data
You have access to this dataset, directly extracted from the company's database. Here are the available files:
•	Sales (called "Transactions").
•	The list of customers.
•	The list of products.
Your tasks
Task 1
Before diving into the analysis, you'll need to clean your data by treating missing values and outliers.
Task 2
Now you can analyze your data. Your manager has given you a high degree of freedom on this task, so it’s is up to you to find the most relevant information. 
To test your skills, your manager want you to use at least:
•	Indicators of central tendency and dispersion.
•	A concentration analysis, using a Lorenz curve and a Gini coefficient.
•	Graphic representations, including at least one histogram, a representation with boxplots, and a time series graph (i.e a graph in which the abscissa axis represents dates).
•	Bivariate analyses.
Task 3
Your manager has also asked a few more questions:
•	Is there a correlation between gender and categories of products purchased?
•	Is there a correlation between age and:
o	The total amount of purchases?
o	The purchase frequency (the number of purchases per month for example)?
o	The average basket size (in number of items)?
o	Categories of purchased products?
